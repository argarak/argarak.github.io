Therefore, I have not written all of the code, only modified it a little for my purposes.\n\nAlso, since I use a version control system, git, you are able to access all the changes of every single commit (where you push some changes to a repository). You may find them by clicking on one of the repositories on either of the pages, and then clicking on on “`%i`{class=\"inline\"} commits”, where `%i`{class=\"inline\"} is a number. \n\n![An image of the commits menu on top of all the repository files.](commits.png){md-lightbox=\"\"}\n\nHere's a list of all of my projects on Github:\n\n![The argarak.github.io website on mobile](nexus.png){md-lightbox=\"\"}\n\n* [argarak.github.io](https://github.com/argarak/argarak.github.io) is this very page. It is hosted on Github pages, free client-side only hosting (therefore, no PHP or NodeJS scripts running on the server, only HTML, CSS and client-side Javascript). Some of the website's features include:\n    * Static-site generation with the use of [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/). This includes [Jade (now known as Pug)](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) HTML templating (the language compiles into HTML - [see this page's sources here](https://github.com/argarak/argarak.github.io/tree/dev/templates).) Also including the [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) CSS preprocessor (compiles into CSS - [see this page's sources here](https://github.com/argarak/argarak.github.io/blob/dev/contents/css/main.styl).), custom plugins, automatic blog post templating, Jade referenced [header](https://github.com/argarak/argarak.github.io/blob/dev/templates/header.jade) and [footer](https://github.com/argarak/argarak.github.io/blob/dev/templates/footer.jade) pages, automatically generated [RSS](http://www.whatisrss.com/) [feed](/feed.xml), article [JSON](http://json.org/) file - for use in my Angular back-end, which brings me onto...\n    * Angular integration. This allows my website to be more interactive ([Source](https://github.com/argarak/argarak.github.io/blob/dev/contents/js/angularMain.js)). For instance:\n        * The redirection of pages without the need to refresh (with the use of [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router))\n        * Search capability on the [blog](/#/blog) page, also including the ability to filter by tag (which also requires the loading of the JSON file which stores all the article data);\n        * Pre-loaders on the [repositories](/#/programs) and [microblogging](/#/microblog) pages;\n        * Fetching of microblog data from my [pump.io](http://pump.io) provider, currently very inefficient since the data is parsed on a remote server, [feednami](https://sekando.com/docs/feednami), also this is why it is so slow to load;\n        * And finally, the list of repositories on my [repositories](/#/programs) page, fetches data from the Github APIs.\n        * *Also note that I’m using version 1.x of the Angular framework*\n    * Use of the [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/) framework. This allows for flexible layouts, many types of elements, theming and colours which all follow the recent [Google Material guidelines](https://material.google.com/). Please note that my website does not fully follow the guidelines and does not intend to do so.\n    * If you would like to know some history behind my website, see my article [“The Evolution of Argarak’s Nexus”](/#/articles/nexus-evolution?title=The Evolution of Argarak's Nexus). Do note that some information on this page is deprecated.\n    * FYI - This website is still not finished, there are many problems, especially with the support of various browsers. If any problems occur, please make a new issue at [the issues page](https://github.com/argarak/argarak.github.io/issues).\n\n<hr>\n\n![Screenshot of the running game.](delta.png){md-lightbox=\"\"}\n\n* [Delta-Cubed (Δ³)](http://argarak.github.io/delta-cubed/), [Source](https://github.com/argarak/delta-cubed) (Warning: includes sound!) is a little game experiment I did a long time ago, it’s not complete and probably never will be. Some features of the “game” include:\n    * Loading map data from CSV files and mapping them to different colours to create a full map ([source](https://github.com/argarak/delta-cubed/blob/master/libraries/loadMap.js)), this is made with the use of the [jsiso](http://jsiso.com/) library;\n    * Sound with the use of the [howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) library, only used for the [background music](https://github.com/argarak/delta-cubed/tree/master/music);\n    * And map changing, when the triangle moves to a specific area of the map, another map is loaded.\n\nI did have some ambitions for the game, for example an isometric battle system, other characters and mouse path finding, however with the use of the deprecated library jsiso, I became frustrated and left it. If I ever write it again, I’ll use a different engine.\n\n![Screenshot of the unfinished Podcurse application in a virtual terminal.](podcurse.png){md-lightbox=\"\"}\n\n* [Podcurse](https://github.com/argarak/podcurse) is a completely unfinished application, aiming to be a MPD client for listening to podcasts. There’s not much I can say about it, as I will never work on it again, eventually I’ll remove it from my repositories.\n\n*Could not provide an image since this is neither a graphical or console application*\n\n* [miscr](https://github.com/argarak/miscr) is my attempt at writing a [stepper motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor) control system for [computer numerical control (CNC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control) machines. It aims to provide G-Code parsing, G-Code transfer from Bluetooth, an SD Card or a Serial connection, provide a HCI with the use of an LCD screen and asynchronous motor control. It is currently under development.\n\n\n# My Workflow\n\nHere are a collection of various software I use everyday to achieve a convenient environment for software development:\n\n## Emacs (Spacemacs)\n\n![A screenshot of the running editor, viewing the angularMain.js file.](emacs.png){md-lightbox=\"\"}\n\nI have used many editors it the past, from IDEs such as Netbeans and Cloud9 to editors like Notepad++. However, there is something about the modular editors like Emacs and Vim that make it truly yours. These editors have a built in configuration system and a package manager to add more flexibility and customisation to your editor.\n\nI used to use plain Emacs (therefore no pre-set configuration) with a config. file (`\\x7e/.emacs`{class=\"inline\"}) that I maintained myself, therefore was quite messy. But I have made the switch to [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) which has a high-level system of package management named layers. These are simply package lists you can subscribe to in your `~/.spacemacs`{class=\"inline\"} file. These may include packages for web development, spell checking, LaTeX or specific programming languages. This also makes config. maintenance easy, since it’s all in one file, and is portable, which means that one can copy your config. file and it would automatically download all the packages necessary.\n\n![A comparison between my configuration and the default, plain Emacs, editing my ~/.spacemacs file](emacscomparison.png){md-lightbox=\"\"}\n\n## Awesome Window Manager\n\n![My custom configuration for the awesome window manager with two terminals, one showing the cava visualiser, the other displaying some system info. It also includes the rofi display menu in the middle. ](wm.png){md-lightbox=\"\"}\n\nUnlike Windows, GNU/Linux offers hundreds of graphical and console interfaces you can use to interact with your computer. There are the popular *desktop environments*, most notably [Unity](https://unity.ubuntu.com/), the default Ubuntu interface, [GNOME or GNU Object Model Environment](https://www.gnome.org/), a very popular and sleek DE, made to be easy to use, [KDE or K Desktop Environment](https://www.kde.org/), a very customisable DE, similar to Windows’ Explorer, however is a little heavyweight and [Xfce](https://xfce.org/), a user-friendly lightweight DE. However, I eventually grew a distaste for them since I wanted an interface I could interact just with the keyboard, an interface I could change to suit my needs.\n\nWindow managers were what I settled for. More specifically, tiling window managers.\n\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<video src=\"http://videobin.org/+efu/i7z.ogg\" md-videobox=\"\"/>\n</div>\n\nThey can be controlled only by the keyboard, are lightweight and very customisable. I settled for [Awesome-WM](https://awesome.naquadah.org/) as my manager of choice as it was very easy to configure (uses Lua as it’s configuration language) and already includes a status bar.\n\n# How I learned to program\n\nI first became interested in programming during my experiments with the graphical language [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). With it, I created small experiments, games interactive cards etc (see all of my scratch content [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/SnakeVenomous/)). I later progressed over to python (also using the [Netbeans IDE](https://netbeans.org/)) where I created small programs to complete trivial tasks, for example reversing text. I also attempted creating some simple games with the [pygame](http://pygame.org/news.html) library, however I usually did not get very far past the graphical interface implementation, I later just got frustrated and decided to move on to something different.\n\nHowever, the main thing that really reinforced my programming skill was the course I took from [edX](https://www.edx.org/), [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). This was a self-paced course that included different tasks to solve with different programming languages, named Problem Sets. The list of Problems Sets in the course I took are as follows (Note that I took CS50x 2015 and the 2016 version differs slightly):\n\n* Problem Set 1:\n    * Hello world program written in C;\n    * Program named “Mario” which would output a right angled triangle of height `n`{class=\"inline\"} after entering the number `n`{class=\"inline\"};\n    * Greedy algorithm which outputs the amount of coins needed to fulfil the amount given.\n    \n* Problem Set 2:\n    * Program which output the initials of a given string (i.e. “John Smith” would output “JS”);\n    * Encryption program named “Caesar” which encrypts strings with the use of the [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher);\n    * And another encryption program named “Vigenere” which encrypts strings with the [Vigenère cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher).\n  \n* Problem Set 3:\n    * Find program which asks the user to input a sequence of numbers (haystack), sorts the numbers (bubble sort), and finds the number given (needle);\n    * Breakout clone using the [SPL Graphics Library](http://stanford.edu/~stepp/cppdoc/), includes lives, scores depending on brick height, “God” mode (where the paddle moves according to the ball’s X axis) and more.\n\n* Problem Set 4:\n    * Had to answer a series of questions;\n    * Whodunit, a program which reveals “the culprit”, by removing all the red pixels hiding the image;\n    * Program that copies BMP files;\n    * Resize, a program which resizes BMP files, where it was fun to see many corrupted image files in early stages;\n    * Recover, a program which recovers JPEG files from a camera’s RAW file.\n  \n* Problem Set 5:\n    * Spell checker implementation, loads a dictionary file and checks a file of any words that are not in the dictionary, I think. I tried to read the code but can’t begin to understand what I’ve actually written! The total time is exactly 0.5942 seconds.\n  \n* Problem Set 6:\n    * Server implementation with support for PHP, static files such as images, and HTML files. Note, not all the server was written by me, only select portions that were missed out.

It is currently under development.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"my-workflow\">My Workflow</h1>\n<p>Here are a collection of various software I use everyday to achieve a convenient environment for software development:</p>\n<h2 id=\"emacs-spacemacs\">Emacs (Spacemacs)</h2>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"emacs.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the running editor, viewing the angularMain.js file.\" md-lightbox=\"&quot;&quot;\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">A screenshot of the running editor, viewing the angularMain.js file.</p>\n</div>\n<p>I have used many editors it the past, from IDEs such as Netbeans and Cloud9 to editors like Notepad++. However, there is something about the modular editors like Emacs and Vim that make it truly yours. These editors have a built in configuration system and a package manager to add more flexibility and customisation to your editor.</p>\n<p>I used to use plain Emacs (therefore no pre-set configuration) with a config. file (<code class=\"inline\">\\x7e/.emacs</code>) that I maintained myself, therefore was quite messy. But I have made the switch to <a href=\"http://spacemacs.org/\">Spacemacs</a> which has a high-level system of package management named layers. These are simply package lists you can subscribe to in your <code class=\"inline\">~/.spacemacs</code> file. These may include packages for web development, spell checking, LaTeX or specific programming languages. This also makes config. maintenance easy, since it’s all in one file, and is portable, which means that one can copy your config. file and it would automatically download all the packages necessary.</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"emacscomparison.png\" alt=\"A comparison between my configuration and the default, plain Emacs, editing my ~/.spacemacs file\" md-lightbox=\"&quot;&quot;\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">A comparison between my configuration and the default, plain Emacs, editing my ~/.spacemacs file</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"awesome-window-manager\">Awesome Window Manager</h2>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"wm.png\" alt=\"My custom configuration for the awesome window manager with two terminals, one showing the cava visualiser, the other displaying some system info.

It also includes the rofi display menu in the middle.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Unlike Windows, GNU/Linux offers hundreds of graphical and console interfaces you can use to interact with your computer. There are the popular <em>desktop environments</em>, most notably <a href=\"https://unity.ubuntu.com/\">Unity</a>, the default Ubuntu interface, <a href=\"https://www.gnome.org/\">GNOME or GNU Object Model Environment</a>, a very popular and sleek DE, made to be easy to use, <a href=\"https://www.kde.org/\">KDE or K Desktop Environment</a>, a very customisable DE, similar to Windows’ Explorer, however is a little heavyweight and <a href=\"https://xfce.org/\">Xfce</a>, a user-friendly lightweight DE. However, I eventually grew a distaste for them since I wanted an interface I could interact just with the keyboard, an interface I could change to suit my needs.</p>\n<p>Window managers were what I settled for. More specifically, tiling window managers.</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<video src=\"http://videobin.org/+efu/i7z.ogg\" md-videobox=\"\"/>\n</div>\n<p>They can be controlled only by the keyboard, are lightweight and very customisable. I settled for <a href=\"https://awesome.naquadah.org/\">Awesome-WM</a> as my manager of choice as it was very easy to configure (uses Lua as it’s configuration language) and already includes a status bar.</p>\n<h1 id=\"how-i-learned-to-program\">How I learned to program</h1>\n<p>I first became interested in programming during my experiments with the graphical language <a href=\"https://scratch.mit.edu/\">Scratch</a>. With it, I created small experiments, games interactive cards etc (see all of my scratch content <a href=\"https://scratch.mit.edu/users/SnakeVenomous/\">here</a>). I later progressed over to python (also using the <a href=\"https://netbeans.org/\">Netbeans IDE</a>) where I created small programs to complete trivial tasks, for example reversing text. I also attempted creating some simple games with the <a href=\"http://pygame.org/news.html\">pygame</a> library, however I usually did not get very far past the graphical interface implementation, I later just got frustrated and decided to move on to something different.</p>\n<p>However, the main thing that really reinforced my programming skill was the course I took from <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/\">edX</a>, <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x\">CS50x</a>. This was a self-paced course that included different tasks to solve with different programming languages, named Problem Sets. The list of Problems Sets in the course I took are as follows (Note that I took CS50x 2015 and the 2016 version differs slightly):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem Set 1:\n<ul>\n<li>Hello world program written in C;</li>\n<li>Program named “Mario” which would output a right angled triangle of height <code class=\"inline\">n</code> after entering the number <code class=\"inline\">n</code>;</li>\n<li>Greedy algorithm which outputs the amount of coins needed to fulfil the amount given.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Problem Set 2:\n<ul>\n<li>Program which output the initials of a given string (i.e. “John Smith” would output “JS”);</li>\n<li>Encryption program named “Caesar” which encrypts strings with the use of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher\">Caesar cipher</a>;</li>\n<li>And another encryption program named “Vigenere” which encrypts strings with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher\">Vigenère cipher</a>.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Problem Set 3:\n<ul>\n<li>Find program which asks the user to input a sequence of numbers (haystack), sorts the numbers (bubble sort), and finds the number given (needle);</li>\n<li>Breakout clone using the <a href=\"http://stanford.edu/~stepp/cppdoc/\">SPL Graphics Library</a>, includes lives, scores depending on brick height, “God” mode (where the paddle moves according to the ball’s X axis) and more.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Problem Set 4:\n<ul>\n<li>Had to answer a series of questions;</li>\n<li>Whodunit, a program which reveals “the culprit”, by removing all the red pixels hiding the image;</li>\n<li>Program that copies BMP files;</li>\n<li>Resize, a program which resizes BMP files, where it was fun to see many corrupted image files in early stages;</li>\n<li>Recover, a program which recovers JPEG files from a camera’s RAW file.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Problem Set 5:\n<ul>\n<li>Spell checker implementation, loads a dictionary file and checks a file of any words that are not in the dictionary, I think. I tried to read the code but can’t begin to understand what I’ve actually written! The total time is exactly 0.5942 seconds.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Problem Set 6:\n<ul>\n<li>Server implementation with support for PHP, static files such as images, and HTML files. Note, not all the server was written by me, only select portions that were missed out. Again, I can’t understand most of it.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Problem Set 7:\n<ul>\n<li>PHP application named C$50 Finance, allows for the register and login of users, current stock prices from the Yahoo APIs, and the buying and selling of (fake) shares. All of this is kept in a SQL database.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Problem Set 8:\n<ul>\n<li>Back-end web application which integrates Google Maps with Google News. Markers are placed on the map, which the user may click on and see the news for that area.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, I cannot post the source code publicly, since that is against the CS50 rules.

However, there is something about the modular editors like Emacs and Vim that make it truly yours. These editors have a built in configuration system and a package manager to add more flexibility and customisation to your editor.</p>\n<p>I used to use plain Emacs (therefore no pre-set configuration) with a config. file (<code class=\"inline\">\\x7e/.emacs</code>) that I maintained myself, therefore was quite messy. But I have made the switch to <a href=\"http://spacemacs.org/\">Spacemacs</a> which has a high-level system of package management named layers. These are simply package lists you can subscribe to in your <code class=\"inline\">~/.spacemacs</code> file. These may include packages for web development, spell checking, LaTeX or specific programming languages. This also makes config. maintenance easy, since it’s all in one file, and is portable, which means that one can copy your config. file and it would automatically download all the packages necessary.</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"/articles/what-ive-been-up-to/emacscomparison.png\" alt=\"A comparison between my configuration and the default, plain Emacs, editing my ~/.spacemacs file\" md-lightbox=\"&quot;&quot;\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">A comparison between my configuration and the default, plain Emacs, editing my ~/.spacemacs file</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"awesome-window-manager\">Awesome Window Manager</h2>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"/articles/what-ive-been-up-to/wm.png\" alt=\"My custom configuration for the awesome window manager with two terminals, one showing the cava visualiser, the other displaying some system info.

There are the popular <em>desktop environments</em>, most notably <a href=\"https://unity.ubuntu.com/\">Unity</a>, the default Ubuntu interface, <a href=\"https://www.gnome.org/\">GNOME or GNU Object Model Environment</a>, a very popular and sleek DE, made to be easy to use, <a href=\"https://www.kde.org/\">KDE or K Desktop Environment</a>, a very customisable DE, similar to Windows’ Explorer, however is a little heavyweight and <a href=\"https://xfce.org/\">Xfce</a>, a user-friendly lightweight DE. However, I eventually grew a distaste for them since I wanted an interface I could interact just with the keyboard, an interface I could change to suit my needs.</p>\n<p>Window managers were what I settled for. More specifically, tiling window managers.</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<video src=\"http://videobin.org/+efu/i7z.ogg\" md-videobox=\"\"/>\n</div>\n<p>They can be controlled only by the keyboard, are lightweight and very customisable. I settled for <a href=\"https://awesome.naquadah.org/\">Awesome-WM</a> as my manager of choice as it was very easy to configure (uses Lua as it’s configuration language) and already includes a status bar.</p>\n<h1 id=\"how-i-learned-to-program\">How I learned to program</h1>\n<p>I first became interested in programming during my experiments with the graphical language <a href=\"https://scratch.mit.edu/\">Scratch</a>. With it, I created small experiments, games interactive cards etc (see all of my scratch content <a href=\"https://scratch.mit.edu/users/SnakeVenomous/\">here</a>). I later progressed over to python (also using the <a href=\"https://netbeans.org/\">Netbeans IDE</a>) where I created small programs to complete trivial tasks, for example reversing text. I also attempted creating some simple games with the <a href=\"http://pygame.org/news.html\">pygame</a> library, however I usually did not get very far past the graphical interface implementation, I later just got frustrated and decided to move on to something different.</p>\n<p>However, the main thing that really reinforced my programming skill was the course I took from <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/\">edX</a>, <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x\">CS50x</a>. This was a self-paced course that included different tasks to solve with different programming languages, named Problem Sets. The list of Problems Sets in the course I took are as follows (Note that I took CS50x 2015 and the 2016 version differs slightly):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem Set 1:\n<ul>\n<li>Hello world program written in C;</li>\n<li>Program named “Mario” which would output a right angled triangle of height <code class=\"inline\">n</code> after entering the number <code class=\"inline\">n</code>;</li>\n<li>Greedy algorithm which outputs the amount of coins needed to fulfil the amount given.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Problem Set 2:\n<ul>\n<li>Program which output the initials of a given string (i.e. “John Smith” would output “JS”);</li>\n<li>Encryption program named “Caesar” which encrypts strings with the use of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher\">Caesar cipher</a>;</li>\n<li>And another encryption program named “Vigenere” which encrypts strings with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher\">Vigenère cipher</a>.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Problem Set 3:\n<ul>\n<li>Find program which asks the user to input a sequence of numbers (haystack), sorts the numbers (bubble sort), and finds the number given (needle);</li>\n<li>Breakout clone using the <a href=\"http://stanford.edu/~stepp/cppdoc/\">SPL Graphics Library</a>, includes lives, scores depending on brick height, “God” mode (where the paddle moves according to the ball’s X axis) and more.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Problem Set 4:\n<ul>\n<li>Had to answer a series of questions;</li>\n<li>Whodunit, a program which reveals “the culprit”, by removing all the red pixels hiding the image;</li>\n<li>Program that copies BMP files;</li>\n<li>Resize, a program which resizes BMP files, where it was fun to see many corrupted image files in early stages;</li>\n<li>Recover, a program which recovers JPEG files from a camera’s RAW file.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Problem Set 5:\n<ul>\n<li>Spell checker implementation, loads a dictionary file and checks a file of any words that are not in the dictionary, I think. I tried to read the code but can’t begin to understand what I’ve actually written! The total time is exactly 0.5942 seconds.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Problem Set 6:\n<ul>\n<li>Server implementation with support for PHP, static files such as images, and HTML files. Note, not all the server was written by me, only select portions that were missed out. Again, I can’t understand most of it.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Problem Set 7:\n<ul>\n<li>PHP application named C$50 Finance, allows for the register and login of users, current stock prices from the Yahoo APIs, and the buying and selling of (fake) shares.

However, if you do want to see the source, please <a href=\"/#/about#contact\">email me</a>.</p>\n<p>I later progressed to move on to Github and making projects which I have documented previously.</p>\n<p><em>That’s all I’m going to document, there probably was more, however they were probably insignificant…</em></p>\n<p><em>Also, there is no comment system yet since this site does not currently have a dedicated server, therefore I can’t run back-end scripts.

Let's take a look back at what Argarak's Nexus was.\n\n<hr>\n\n**NOTE: This was written before version 3 of this website! Some information may be invalid to the current version.**\n\n## The name\n\nI took the name Argarak as an alias because it is a ship captain name of the Ilwrath species in the game Star Control 2, which is one of my favourite games of all time. (Though Heroes of Might and Magic III is the best)\n\nNexus was just a word which I picked out from a thesaurus. After searching the word “network”, I found the word “nexus”, which was appealing to me - even though my website is not a network. (except only in the sense that it is a network of all the rubbish I make, not a literal network).\n\n## The logo\n\nTo make a memorable website, you require some sort of logo people will remember the first time they see it. This means that your logo has to be somewhat unique to make it stand out. I guess this is more important to some organisation than some blog but I still wanted something I could be identified by.\n\nAnyway, the first logo I came up with looked like this.\n\n![Argarak's Nexus logo used in version 1 and 2.](cropped-nexus-grayscale.png){md-lightbox=\"\"}\n\nNow this is not the first iteration of this logo, the first had a teal background and was slightly thinner (you will see it later on though) but it had the same shape. I chose a hexagon because I like hexagons and the star in the middle with the triangle is meant to represent an “A” for Argarak.\n\nWhen I made version 1, I later did not use this logo, instead I piped it through an image to ASCII converter and used this logo:\n\n![Argarak's Nexus logo (version 1) parsed through the aview/asciiview program.](logo.png){md-lightbox=\"\"}\n\nThis logo was meant to fit in with the background of the website which was also made out of text. This was the most used logo.\n\nAfter a while, when I started to get fed up of version 1, I wanted a different logo. I was sketching in my notebook fairly often, coming up with new ideas. This one came to my after I drew an isometric grid. I drew some pyramids and but a box around it. The new Nexus logo was made.\n\n![Version 2 of the logo used on this page.](nexus.png){md-lightbox=\"\"}\n\nThis is the logo you see now on the side of you screen (or hidden away on mobile).\n\n## Version 0\n\nI always wanted a website of my own. Not really for any particular purpose, other than to put all of my future projects on it. However, there were always difficulties. I did not know HTML or CSS too well, and I did not know any practical JavaScript. Buying a domain name and hosting wasn't too appealing since I did not want to waste money on some website no-one is going to visit. However, I can always make a prototype on my computer!\n\nHowever, before any real development, I decided to make an image of what I wanted the website to look. I used Inkscape to create the image and it somewhat looks similar - but a lot worse - to what it looks today. So let's take a look at it!\n\n![A graphic for my website idea made in Inkscape using the Numix icons on the sidebar.](argarak_idea.png){md-lightbox=\"\"}\n\nNow that's awful design! Post warning, many of these images on this post are going to be quite bad in design. Sorry if it makes you wince. Anyway, As you can see, the desktop sidebar style that version 2 has is present in this image. I've always wanted to make a website with a sidebar for some reason. Frankly, I do not remember fully what those icons meant. I only remember that the top one is the old Nexus logo, the person icon is probably an about page, the gears are most likely some kind of programs repository and the “play” icon is probably about videos or something.\n\nAs you will see later, pre-release version 2 had the same top bar. It's interesting how I've kept a similar design over the year.\n\nFinally, development began. Back then, in 2015, I used the Netbeans IDE for my programming needs. It wasn't very good and had many problems. Also, at the time, I used to love this website called [COLOURlovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/), which had collections of various patterns which I used commonly for my websites. Now, they are too colourful and garish for me to use these days, but back then I always liked to use the background-image element on just about all my tags.\n\nSo here's how it went!\n\n![Version 0 of the site.](v0.png){md-lightbox=\"\"}\n\nSadly, I could not find a source of this website, I could have used it as a basis for another, which I will show soon. Anyway, there are many design flaws with the design. The most obvious one would be the inconsistency of the patterns. The website is light coloured, which is not my style any more, the text on the backgrounds is difficult to read and it's too detailed and has no set palette.\n\nAll of the links on the top of the page blend in to the background too much, therefore are difficult to see and the font sizes are too large and inconsistent. It's not a great website, to say the least.\n\nAs you can read at the bottom of the image, I wanted to learn practical JavaScript however, I did not know jQuery so that's probably why (and yes there are built in ID searching and style setting functions but jQuery is so much easier). *FYI: Version 3 uses Angular and no jQuery*\n\nI believe that this next image is the website that I based this one on. Here's how it looks:\n\n![A site based on the previous version 0.](v0b.png){md-lightbox=\"\"}\n\nAt least with this one the links are easy to read. However, they are too large. The whole site is pretty much empty and abandoned.\n\nThe logo at the top is the same logo we saw earlier, but this time with curly brackets, for no good reason whatsoever. And I licensed it by the GPL because a \\x7e40 odd line HTML file and a CSS file of approximately the same size should be licensed by a strong copyleft licence, because why not! \n\nBy the way, these are from 2015! I'm amazed the amount of progress I made with my website, it is truly astonishing to see how terrible websites can eventually become good ones. \n\n~~Actually, at the time, I did not refer to these sites as Argarak's Nexus, the source for the most recent one shown was called \"some_website\".~~ (Totally false since you see the words “Argarak’s Nexus” on the top of the site!)\n \nOf course, I made many little abandoned blogs (i.e [https://argarak.wordpress.com](https://argarak.wordpress.com)) but I will not cover them because they are pretty boring and not very progressive of the Nexus we have today.\n\n<hr> \n \nI have been interested in secure and private providers of email, and so I went over to [prism-break](https://prism-break.org/en/) and went over to the Email Accounts section of the site and I found the group Autistici/Inventiati who provided many kinds of services, but my main goal was to finally break away from Google Mail and my spam-filled email account to a safer, private and trustworthy provider. So I signed up, sent them a request and they accepted it, which I was fairy glad about. \n\nI don't use email often, especially for day-to-day communications, but without it, it would be difficult to contact developers, make accounts and use or subscribe to mailing lists.\n\nAnyway, I heard that A/I were offering a blogging service, which was intriguing, so I set one up. The service was called \"Noblogs\" and I chose the URL \"nexus.noblogs.org\". Version 1 has begun.\n\n## Version 1\n\nI never really liked Wordpress myself. It's interface is clunky, customisation is weak (client side) - in the sense that the only thing you can change is the CSS of the website - and server side, it's really confusing for me. The themes are made in PHP for some reason.\n\nI also don't like how you can only create posts with the use of some awful GUI.\n\nHowever, it is very easy to use and it was the longest running Nexus and with the most posts.\n\nWordpress also has built in Search and RSS functionality, which makes it even easier to use. (Which is quite a big deal since I always have difficulty implementing search functionality to my sites as you may know)\n\nHere's how the design looked, with the twenty-eleven theme:\n\n![Version 1 of the site generated by Wordpress.](v1.png){md-lightbox=\"\"}\n\nI tried my best in using the themes that were available on the Noblogs service, since it did not have as many themes as Wordpress.com. So I went with a single column design which did not look too bad. The large logo in the centre was a little frustrating while browsing the website. Since every time you visited a page, you would have to scroll through that large logo. The background of the page is the output from the command ```cat /dev/urandom```.\n\nLater on, I used a Python script to create the background. It simply output ASCII characters, however with no spaces. It meant that there was no longer a seam left from the background tiling. I also improved the navigation bar by changing the gradient to a flat colour (specifically #000), made the text larger and changed the font to Raleway. The logo also changed. I ran it through some kind of image to text library (most likely [aa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAlib)) since I liked the idea of having mono-spaced ASCII characters as some sort of style.\n\nSadly, the website is no longer available at all. And I never thought of archiving it on the Wayback Machine. Oh well. Not like anyone read it at the time. However, if you wish, you may download a copy of the Wordpress exported file which contains all of my previous blog posts. Of course, I'm not going to publish them here since they were not very high quality, to say the least. You may download it [here](https://u.pomf.is/ykuafu.xml).\n\nI never blogged there often. It was running for some time (over 6 months) and only so many posts, I wasn't very frequent and I don't expect to change any time soon. \n\n## Version 2\n\nI was getting fed up of Wordpress. No markdown support, had to do everything from a browser and most of the time, the website would not even work properly! I had to do something about this, to make my blogging experience better. And so I proceeded to search blogging platforms. Obviously, the first one that I found was Jekyll. To me Jekyll was puzzling. It was simple in the sense that I could just put markdown files in the posts directory. However, the templating engine was confusing and not what I was used to. I made many websites before with HTML (Jade), CSS (Stylus) and Javascript. So making a good looking website was not a problem. What was the problem was that I could not find a good engine that was suitable for someone who simply wanted a way to create templates using HTML and not Javascript and especially not PHP (not that I hate PHP, it's just that I don't know why you would do such a thing)!\n\nHowever, before any engines, I decided to make a prototype structure for the look and feel of the website. There's the first prototype.\n\n![Prototype 0 of version 2 of the site.](p0.png){md-lightbox=\"\"}\n\nThe only interesting thing that this site offered was that if you hovered over that thing Nexus logo, the image would fade into the coloured version. I used the [Pure](http://purecss.io/) CSS library for my framework. I only chose it because it had side navigation support.\n\nAnother prototype was made, however I will not show it to you because it is even less finished than the prototype I showed you. It's basically the same website however, it has the navigation menu at the bottom. However, I did scrap that idea and continued to stick with the side navigation design.\n\nAnyway, back to engines...\n\nI found Punch. A static site generator which used simple the Mustache template engine. You reference JSON variables with the use of `\\{\\{brackets\\}\\}`, (I had to escape it due to Angular thinking it was a variable) that Punch provides. Now my website is actually based on the [punch-blog](https://github.com/laktek/punch-blog) template which includes helper scripts that read and parse Markdown files in the posts directory. It also includes scripts to manage the Archive and the Blog section of my site.\n\nWhen I was building the website your on just now, I disliked the example site it came with and scrapped it completely. (It also came with tracking Twitter handles and other social media rubbish I don't use) At the time, I heard of Google's [material design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) guidelines and the [Materialise CSS](http://materializecss.com/) framework. (Note that my website does not fully meet the requirements as of the time of writing but I hope to achieve that soon) And so I put Materialise on it and stated development. I first made the website myself but I found implementing a proper side navigation menu challenging so I decided to fork the Materialise website and copy the menu from there. But even after that, it was still really hard. I never found a direct example of this on the internet so I had to try myself. I do not remember the exact procedure of making a side navigation menu solely with icons but it certainly took a while. The first website did not have icons on the centre of the screen, instead they were on the top. They were also black and white opposed to the many colours on the icons on the side, which do make the icons stand out. \n\n![Navigation menu of the first published version of the site version 2.](oldSidebar.png){md-lightbox=\"\"}\n\nMy old website also had a top search and title bar. The title of the page was on it but it also transformed into a large search menu. (The search did not work of course) I also used the font [Raleway](https://github.com/theleagueof/raleway) for the main text, now I use [Roboto](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto). ~~However, I do still use Raleway on the landing page.~~\n\nNow I can't really and will not document a lot on the technical development of this website as it would take too long and I don't really remember it well. (I also don't keep snapshots of my projects) However, you may see a list of my Github commits right [here](https://github.com/argarak/argarak.github.io/commits/dev).\n\nWell that's it for the history of Argarak's Nexus. Many versions but I finally made one I'm happy with. \n\n<div id=\"bottomspace\"></div>\n\n<hr>\n\nIf you were wondering, this is space so that the material box works properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","_htmlraw":"<p>Argarak’s Nexus has drastically evolved in a short period (approximately one year). Let’s take a look back at what Argarak’s Nexus was.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>NOTE: This was written before version 3 of this website! Some information may be invalid to the current version.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-name\">The name</h2>\n<p>I took the name Argarak as an alias because it is a ship captain name of the Ilwrath species in the game Star Control 2, which is one of my favourite games of all time. (Though Heroes of Might and Magic III is the best)</p>\n<p>Nexus was just a word which I picked out from a thesaurus. After searching the word “network”, I found the word “nexus”, which was appealing to me - even though my website is not a network. (except only in the sense that it is a network of all the rubbish I make, not a literal network).</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-logo\">The logo</h2>\n<p>To make a memorable website, you require some sort of logo people will remember the first time they see it. This means that your logo has to be somewhat unique to make it stand out. I guess this is more important to some organisation than some blog but I still wanted something I could be identified by.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the first logo I came up with looked like this.</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"cropped-nexus-grayscale.png\" alt=\"Argarak’s Nexus logo used in version 1 and 2.\" md-lightbox=\"&quot;&quot;\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Argarak’s Nexus logo used in version 1 and 2.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Now this is not the first iteration of this logo, the first had a teal background and was slightly thinner (you will see it later on though) but it had the same shape. I chose a hexagon because I like hexagons and the star in the middle with the triangle is meant to represent an “A” for Argarak.</p>\n<p>When I made version 1, I later did not use this logo, instead I piped it through an image to ASCII converter and used this logo:</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"logo.png\" alt=\"Argarak’s Nexus logo (version 1) parsed through the aview/asciiview program.\" md-lightbox=\"&quot;&quot;\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Argarak’s Nexus logo (version 1) parsed through the aview/asciiview program.</p>\n</div>\n<p>This logo was meant to fit in with the background of the website which was also made out of text. This was the most used logo.</p>\n<p>After a while, when I started to get fed up of version 1, I wanted a different logo. I was sketching in my notebook fairly often, coming up with new ideas. This one came to my after I drew an isometric grid. I drew some pyramids and but a box around it. The new Nexus logo was made.</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"nexus.png\" alt=\"Version 2 of the logo used on this page.\" md-lightbox=\"&quot;&quot;\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Version 2 of the logo used on this page.</p>\n</div>\n<p>This is the logo you see now on the side of you screen (or hidden away on mobile).</p>\n<h2 id=\"version-0\">Version 0</h2>\n<p>I always wanted a website of my own. Not really for any particular purpose, other than to put all of my future projects on it. However, there were always difficulties. I did not know HTML or CSS too well, and I did not know any practical JavaScript. Buying a domain name and hosting wasn’t too appealing since I did not want to waste money on some website no-one is going to visit. However, I can always make a prototype on my computer!</p>\n<p>However, before any real development, I decided to make an image of what I wanted the website to look. I used Inkscape to create the image and it somewhat looks similar - but a lot worse - to what it looks today. So let’s take a look at it!</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"argarak_idea.png\" alt=\"A graphic for my website idea made in Inkscape using the Numix icons on the sidebar.\" md-lightbox=\"&quot;&quot;\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">A graphic for my website idea made in Inkscape using the Numix icons on the sidebar.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Now that’s awful design! Post warning, many of these images on this post are going to be quite bad in design. Sorry if it makes you wince. Anyway, As you can see, the desktop sidebar style that version 2 has is present in this image. I’ve always wanted to make a website with a sidebar for some reason. Frankly, I do not remember fully what those icons meant. I only remember that the top one is the old Nexus logo, the person icon is probably an about page, the gears are most likely some kind of programs repository and the “play” icon is probably about videos or something.</p>\n<p>As you will see later, pre-release version 2 had the same top bar. It’s interesting how I’ve kept a similar design over the year.</p>\n<p>Finally, development began. Back then, in 2015, I used the Netbeans IDE for my programming needs. It wasn’t very good and had many problems. Also, at the time, I used to love this website called <a href=\"http://www.colourlovers.com/\">COLOURlovers</a>, which had collections of various patterns which I used commonly for my websites. Now, they are too colourful and garish for me to use these days, but back then I always liked to use the background-image element on just about all my tags.</p>\n<p>So here’s how it went!</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"v0.png\" alt=\"Version 0 of the site.\" md-lightbox=\"&quot;&quot;\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Version 0 of the site.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Sadly, I could not find a source of this website, I could have used it as a basis for another, which I will show soon. Anyway, there are many design flaws with the design. The most obvious one would be the inconsistency of the patterns. The website is light coloured, which is not my style any more, the text on the backgrounds is difficult to read and it’s too detailed and has no set palette.</p>\n<p>All of the links on the top of the page blend in to the background too much, therefore are difficult to see and the font sizes are too large and inconsistent. It’s not a great website, to say the least.</p>\n<p>As you can read at the bottom of the image, I wanted to learn practical JavaScript however, I did not know jQuery so that’s probably why (and yes there are built in ID searching and style setting functions but jQuery is so much easier). <em>FYI: Version 3 uses Angular and no jQuery</em></p>\n<p>I believe that this next image is the website that I based this one on. Here’s how it looks:</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"v0b.png\" alt=\"A site based on the previous version 0.\" md-lightbox=\"&quot;&quot;\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">A site based on the previous version 0.</p>\n</div>\n<p>At least with this one the links are easy to read. However, they are too large. The whole site is pretty much empty and abandoned.</p>\n<p>The logo at the top is the same logo we saw earlier, but this time with curly brackets, for no good reason whatsoever. And I licensed it by the GPL because a \\x7e40 odd line HTML file and a CSS file of approximately the same size should be licensed by a strong copyleft licence, because why not!</p>\n<p>By the way, these are from 2015! I’m amazed the amount of progress I made with my website, it is truly astonishing to see how terrible websites can eventually become good ones.</p>\n<p><del>Actually, at the time, I did not refer to these sites as Argarak’s Nexus, the source for the most recent one shown was called “some_website”.</del> (Totally false since you see the words “Argarak’s Nexus” on the top of the site!)</p>\n<p>Of course, I made many little abandoned blogs (i.e <a href=\"https://argarak.wordpress.com\" class=\"uri\">https://argarak.wordpress.com</a>) but I will not cover them because they are pretty boring and not very progressive of the Nexus we have today.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I have been interested in secure and private providers of email, and so I went over to <a href=\"https://prism-break.org/en/\">prism-break</a> and went over to the Email Accounts section of the site and I found the group Autistici/Inventiati who provided many kinds of services, but my main goal was to finally break away from Google Mail and my spam-filled email account to a safer, private and trustworthy provider. So I signed up, sent them a request and they accepted it, which I was fairy glad about.</p>\n<p>I don’t use email often, especially for day-to-day communications, but without it, it would be difficult to contact developers, make accounts and use or subscribe to mailing lists.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I heard that A/I were offering a blogging service, which was intriguing, so I set one up.

So let’s take a look at it!</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"/articles/nexus-evolution/argarak_idea.png\" alt=\"A graphic for my website idea made in Inkscape using the Numix icons on the sidebar.\" md-lightbox=\"&quot;&quot;\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">A graphic for my website idea made in Inkscape using the Numix icons on the sidebar.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Now that’s awful design! Post warning, many of these images on this post are going to be quite bad in design. Sorry if it makes you wince. Anyway, As you can see, the desktop sidebar style that version 2 has is present in this image. I’ve always wanted to make a website with a sidebar for some reason. Frankly, I do not remember fully what those icons meant. I only remember that the top one is the old Nexus logo, the person icon is probably an about page, the gears are most likely some kind of programs repository and the “play” icon is probably about videos or something.</p>\n<p>As you will see later, pre-release version 2 had the same top bar. It’s interesting how I’ve kept a similar design over the year.</p>\n<p>Finally, development began. Back then, in 2015, I used the Netbeans IDE for my programming needs. It wasn’t very good and had many problems. Also, at the time, I used to love this website called <a href=\"http://www.colourlovers.com/\">COLOURlovers</a>, which had collections of various patterns which I used commonly for my websites. Now, they are too colourful and garish for me to use these days, but back then I always liked to use the background-image element on just about all my tags.</p>\n<p>So here’s how it went!</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"/articles/nexus-evolution/v0.png\" alt=\"Version 0 of the site.\" md-lightbox=\"&quot;&quot;\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Version 0 of the site.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Sadly, I could not find a source of this website, I could have used it as a basis for another, which I will show soon. Anyway, there are many design flaws with the design. The most obvious one would be the inconsistency of the patterns. The website is light coloured, which is not my style any more, the text on the backgrounds is difficult to read and it’s too detailed and has no set palette.</p>\n<p>All of the links on the top of the page blend in to the background too much, therefore are difficult to see and the font sizes are too large and inconsistent. It’s not a great website, to say the least.</p>\n<p>As you can read at the bottom of the image, I wanted to learn practical JavaScript however, I did not know jQuery so that’s probably why (and yes there are built in ID searching and style setting functions but jQuery is so much easier). <em>FYI: Version 3 uses Angular and no jQuery</em></p>\n<p>I believe that this next image is the website that I based this one on. Here’s how it looks:</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"/articles/nexus-evolution/v0b.png\" alt=\"A site based on the previous version 0.\" md-lightbox=\"&quot;&quot;\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">A site based on the previous version 0.</p>\n</div>\n<p>At least with this one the links are easy to read. However, they are too large. The whole site is pretty much empty and abandoned.</p>\n<p>The logo at the top is the same logo we saw earlier, but this time with curly brackets, for no good reason whatsoever. And I licensed it by the GPL because a \\x7e40 odd line HTML file and a CSS file of approximately the same size should be licensed by a strong copyleft licence, because why not!</p>\n<p>By the way, these are from 2015! I’m amazed the amount of progress I made with my website, it is truly astonishing to see how terrible websites can eventually become good ones.</p>\n<p><del>Actually, at the time, I did not refer to these sites as Argarak’s Nexus, the source for the most recent one shown was called “some_website”.</del> (Totally false since you see the words “Argarak’s Nexus” on the top of the site!)</p>\n<p>Of course, I made many little abandoned blogs (i.e <a href=\"https://argarak.wordpress.com\" class=\"uri\">https://argarak.wordpress.com</a>) but I will not cover them because they are pretty boring and not very progressive of the Nexus we have today.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I have been interested in secure and private providers of email, and so I went over to <a href=\"https://prism-break.org/en/\">prism-break</a> and went over to the Email Accounts section of the site and I found the group Autistici/Inventiati who provided many kinds of services, but my main goal was to finally break away from Google Mail and my spam-filled email account to a safer, private and trustworthy provider. So I signed up, sent them a request and they accepted it, which I was fairy glad about.</p>\n<p>I don’t use email often, especially for day-to-day communications, but without it, it would be difficult to contact developers, make accounts and use or subscribe to mailing lists.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I heard that A/I were offering a blogging service, which was intriguing, so I set one up. The service was called “Noblogs” and I chose the URL “nexus.noblogs.org”. Version 1 has begun.</p>\n<h2 id=\"version-1\">Version 1</h2>\n<p>I never really liked Wordpress myself. It’s interface is clunky, customisation is weak (client side) - in the sense that the only thing you can change is the CSS of the website - and server side, it’s really confusing for me. The themes are made in PHP for some reason.</p>\n<p>I also don’t like how you can only create posts with the use of some awful GUI.</p>\n<p>However, it is very easy to use and it was the longest running Nexus and with the most posts.</p>\n<p>Wordpress also has built in Search and RSS functionality, which makes it even easier to use. (Which is quite a big deal since I always have difficulty implementing search functionality to my sites as you may know)</p>\n<p>Here’s how the design looked, with the twenty-eleven theme:</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"/articles/nexus-evolution/v1.png\" alt=\"Version 1 of the site generated by Wordpress.\" md-lightbox=\"&quot;&quot;\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Version 1 of the site generated by Wordpress.</p>\n</div>\n<p>I tried my best in using the themes that were available on the Noblogs service, since it did not have as many themes as Wordpress.com. So I went with a single column design which did not look too bad. The large logo in the centre was a little frustrating while browsing the website. Since every time you visited a page, you would have to scroll through that large logo. The background of the page is the output from the command <code>cat /dev/urandom</code>.</p>\n<p>Later on, I used a Python script to create the background. It simply output ASCII characters, however with no spaces. It meant that there was no longer a seam left from the background tiling. I also improved the navigation bar by changing the gradient to a flat colour (specifically #000), made the text larger and changed the font to Raleway. The logo also changed. I ran it through some kind of image to text library (most likely <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAlib\">aa</a>) since I liked the idea of having mono-spaced ASCII characters as some sort of style.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the website is no longer available at all. And I never thought of archiving it on the Wayback Machine. Oh well. Not like anyone read it at the time. However, if you wish, you may download a copy of the Wordpress exported file which contains all of my previous blog posts. Of course, I’m not going to publish them here since they were not very high quality, to say the least. You may download it <a href=\"https://u.pomf.is/ykuafu.xml\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I never blogged there often. It was running for some time (over 6 months) and only so many posts, I wasn’t very frequent and I don’t expect to change any time soon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"version-2\">Version 2</h2>\n<p>I was getting fed up of Wordpress. No markdown support, had to do everything from a browser and most of the time, the website would not even work properly! I had to do something about this, to make my blogging experience better. And so I proceeded to search blogging platforms. Obviously, the first one that I found was Jekyll. To me Jekyll was puzzling. It was simple in the sense that I could just put markdown files in the posts directory. However, the templating engine was confusing and not what I was used to. I made many websites before with HTML (Jade), CSS (Stylus) and Javascript. So making a good looking website was not a problem. What was the problem was that I could not find a good engine that was suitable for someone who simply wanted a way to create templates using HTML and not Javascript and especially not PHP (not that I hate PHP, it’s just that I don’t know why you would do such a thing)!</p>\n<p>However, before any engines, I decided to make a prototype structure for the look and feel of the website. There’s the first prototype.</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"/articles/nexus-evolution/p0.png\" alt=\"Prototype 0 of version 2 of the site.\" md-lightbox=\"&quot;&quot;\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Prototype 0 of version 2 of the site.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The only interesting thing that this site offered was that if you hovered over that thing Nexus logo, the image would fade into the coloured version. I used the <a href=\"http://purecss.io/\">Pure</a> CSS library for my framework. I only chose it because it had side navigation support.</p>\n<p>Another prototype was made, however I will not show it to you because it is even less finished than the prototype I showed you. It’s basically the same website however, it has the navigation menu at the bottom. However, I did scrap that idea and continued to stick with the side navigation design.</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to engines…</p>\n<p>I found Punch. A static site generator which used simple the Mustache template engine. You reference JSON variables with the use of <code>\\{\\{brackets\\}\\}</code>, (I had to escape it due to Angular thinking it was a variable) that Punch provides. Now my website is actually based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/laktek/punch-blog\">punch-blog</a> template which includes helper scripts that read and parse Markdown files in the posts directory. It also includes scripts to manage the Archive and the Blog section of my site.</p>\n<p>When I was building the website your on just now, I disliked the example site it came with and scrapped it completely. (It also came with tracking Twitter handles and other social media rubbish I don’t use) At the time, I heard of Google’s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html\">material design</a> guidelines and the <a href=\"http://materializecss.com/\">Materialise CSS</a> framework. (Note that my website does not fully meet the requirements as of the time of writing but I hope to achieve that soon) And so I put Materialise on it and stated development. I first made the website myself but I found implementing a proper side navigation menu challenging so I decided to fork the Materialise website and copy the menu from there. But even after that, it was still really hard. I never found a direct example of this on the internet so I had to try myself. I do not remember the exact procedure of making a side navigation menu solely with icons but it certainly took a while. The first website did not have icons on the centre of the screen, instead they were on the top. They were also black and white opposed to the many colours on the icons on the side, which do make the icons stand out.</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"/articles/nexus-evolution/oldSidebar.png\" alt=\"Navigation menu of the first published version of the site version 2.\" md-lightbox=\"&quot;&quot;\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Navigation menu of the first published version of the site version 2.</p>\n</div>\n<p>My old website also had a top search and title bar. The title of the page was on it but it also transformed into a large search menu. (The search did not work of course) I also used the font <a href=\"https://github.com/theleagueof/raleway\">Raleway</a> for the main text, now I use <a href=\"https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto\">Roboto</a>. <del>However, I do still use Raleway on the landing page.</del></p>\n<p>Now I can’t really and will not document a lot on the technical development of this website as it would take too long and I don’t really remember it well. (I also don’t keep snapshots of my projects) However, you may see a list of my Github commits right <a href=\"https://github.com/argarak/argarak.github.io/commits/dev\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Well that’s it for the history of Argarak’s Nexus.
