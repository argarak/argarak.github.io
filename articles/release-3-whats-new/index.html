      <h1 id="title" class="backgr">What’s new in Version 3</h1>
      <div class="flow-text"><p>As you might have noticed, version 3 of the Argarak’s Nexus blog has been released! Some fairly standard user-interface changes have occurred, which you may have already noticed. This&nbsp;includes…</p>
<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<ul>
<li>A new landing page with automatically scrolling blog articles, including transitions. (The colours on the panel don’t really mean anything - they’re randomly selected and generally only used for&nbsp;aesthetic);</li>
<li>Slightly darker background - #111111 to&nbsp;#0e0e0e;</li>
<li>No annoying cookies and licensing pop-up - now the licensing information is stored on the top of each article and is displayed with the use of a&nbsp;modal;*</li>
<li>Super responsive - should work on any device with a half-decent&nbsp;browser;</li>
<li>On medium sized devices, the pop-up sidebar has been removed, instead being replaced by a bottom navigation toolbar. I’ve changed this since I’ve read that it’s not <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/04/08/ux-designers-side-drawer-navigation-costing-half-user-engagement/">user engaging.</a>;</li>
<li>Pink and red&nbsp;colour-scheme;</li>
<li>Thicker Nexus&nbsp;Logo;</li>
<li>JavaScript disabled&nbsp;message;</li>
<li>Pink text&nbsp;highlight.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="about-archive-pages">About, Archive&nbsp;pages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bold, red title headers in the Archive and About&nbsp;pages;</li>
<li>Robust <code>base32</code> email munging&nbsp;protection</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="blog-page">Blog&nbsp;page</h2>
<ul>
<li>A search bar! Took a while, but will eventually be an effective filter method when I make more blog posts (which will take a while&nbsp;obviously);</li>
<li>Tag filter support, categorises all blog&nbsp;posts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="programs-page">Programs&nbsp;page</h2>
<ul>
<li>Material&nbsp;pre-loader;</li>
<li>Material-style list of all my current repositories which respond to the click and redirect you to the appropriate repository page on&nbsp;GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="micro-blogging-page">Micro-blogging&nbsp;page</h2>
<ul>
<li>Now I can post quick and short updates and stuffs with the use of a remote <a href="https://pumpyourself.com/">pump.io</a> server (publishing the posts with a program called <a href="https://github.com/xray7224/p"><code>p</code></a>);</li>
<li>Pre-loader again, this time it’s more important as my bodged method of collecting all the posts may take a&nbsp;while;</li>
<li>Displays author, date, description and&nbsp;permalink.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not much at all was changed about the Archive (other than the title) or <span class="caps">RSS</span>&nbsp;page.</p>
<p><em>*If you were wondering the cookies were to actually preserve the pop-up while you were browsing other pages - however, this was not an permanent cookie and it would be erased after you would close the browser. That was the only thing the cookies were used for. I don’t really know why I was showing this pop-up to be honest, as the cookie law does not affect me, and I could have just mentioned the license info. somewhere else on the&nbsp;site.</em></p>
<h1 id="whats-up-with-those-version-names">What’s up with those version&nbsp;names?!</h1>
<p>Those are just codenames I come up with on the spot really. They usually have quite a shallow meaning. For&nbsp;instance;</p>
<ul>
<li>Version 3 - Angled Ink-Pug refers to Angled = Angular, Ink = Stylus <span class="caps">CSS</span> pre-processor and Pug refers to the HTML pre-processor (and no I’ve not changed the <code>.jade</code> files to <code>.pug</code> yet)</li>
<li>Version 2.11 Paper Feather (one that was not published) - Feather because I cut 50 megabytes from stored video files in the history and Paper because I wanted the version to comply more with material design (<del>I’ll</del> <a ui-sref="blog({ name: '', title: ''})">I won’t get onto that…</a>&nbsp;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes version names have no meaning at all, such as version 2 - Horse&nbsp;Radish.</p>
