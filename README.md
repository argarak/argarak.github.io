# Argarak's Nexus
## Wintersmith development branch

## Summary

This is the upcoming version 3 of Argarak's Nexus written in Jade (pug) and Stylus, written with Angular and Angular Material and generated by Wintersmith.

This new version does not have and *completely* different interface, however, it is more refined, and the code back-end is **hugely** different.

The code is a lot cleaner and smaller in size making it more efficient.

However, now the website without Javascript is nearly useless.

## TODO
* Responsive Design
* Programs and Microblog sections
* Titles for all pages
* More backgrounds for index.jade
* License headers
