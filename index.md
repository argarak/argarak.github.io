*FYI - Some information is avaliable on the* [about](/#/about) *page. However, this article will elaborate on some of the points made on this page, and include some more information.*

# Projects

First of all, to find the list of all of my repositories, find them at [my repositories page](/#/repositories) or my [Github page](https://github.com/argarak?tab=repositories).
I also must elaborate that the work "fork" means to clone someone else's code. Therefore, I have not written all of the code, only modified it a little for my purposes.

Also, since I use a version control system, git, you are able to access all of the changes of every single commit (where you push some changes to a repository). You may find them by clicking on one of the repositories on either of the pages, and then clicking on on "%i commits", where %i is a number.

Here's a list of all of my projects on Github:

* [argarak.github.io](https://github.com/argarak/argarak.github.io) is this very page. It is hosted on Github pages, free client-side only hosting (therefore, no PHP or NodeJS scripts running on the server, only HTML, CSS and client-side Javascript). Some of the website's features include:
    * Static-site generation with the use of [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/). This includes [Jade (now known as Pug)](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) HTML templating (the language compiles into HTML - [see this page's sources here](https://github.com/argarak/argarak.github.io/tree/dev/templates).) Also including the [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) CSS preprocessor (compiles into CSS - [see this page's sources here](https://github.com/argarak/argarak.github.io/blob/dev/contents/css/main.styl).), custom plugins, automatic blog post templating, Jade referenced [header]() and [footer]() pages, automatically generated [RSS](http://www.whatisrss.com/) [feed](/feed.xml),
