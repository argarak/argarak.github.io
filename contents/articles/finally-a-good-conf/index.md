title: I've finally took the time to create a half-decent Emacs config.

As you may know, I use Emacs for my text-editing needs. I think it's the best editor ever made <begin [editor war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war) here>. I'm kidding of course. Vi(m) is probably a great editor too - I might take the time to learn it and use Emacs with evil-mode - I really don't care what editor you use - Emacs, Vi(m), nano, ed, or even the one person who edits all of their text by appending it with `echo` or `cat`. *Insert XKCD meme here...*
