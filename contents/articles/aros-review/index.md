AROS (AROS Research Operating System, ooh yet another [recursive acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym)) is an Operating System aiming to be API compatible with Amiga 3.x systems. It is free software, however it does have [licensing issues.](http://www.evillabs.net/AROS/Audit-2012-03-14/AROS-trunk.txt). For the review, I have chosen the Icaros Desktop (version v2.1.2) distribution as it is the most developed and stable (to my knowledge).

I personally have a minor interest for the Amiga systems due to the [Demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) and [mod tracking](https://modarchive.org/) but I've never owned one or have any interest in the games available.
